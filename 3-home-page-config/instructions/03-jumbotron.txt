Jumbotron: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#type-components


Add code below to line 19 in index.html  

		<div class="jumbotron">
                	<img src="img/fruit-500.jpg" alt=" Fruit is yummy! ">
                    <h1>Fruit is delicious</h1>
                    <p>Fruit makes a great snack, or slice it up and eat it with a meal. Portable, sweet, and filling, you can take fruit anywhere, even to a Bootstrap workshop!</p>
                </div>
				
				
				
Additional classes added:

To the image tag, add class  
	img-circle -- turns image into a circle. 
	(other options include img-rounded, img-thumbnail)

To the div/jumbotron, additional classes  
	clearfix -- clears the image

To the image inside the jumbotron, add class				
	pull-right -- floats the image right. Guess what to use for making the image float left instead?

	img-responsive -- makes the image resize responsively. Image stays a fixed size otherwise.
